- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### What do you think of Rails?
* Incredibly awesome tool ONCE you've learned the groundwork
* Lots of files in the file structure
* No lectures left quite isolated
* Easier to work with
* Organized
* KV's videos were great
* Set way of doing things: idiomatic

* Helps new devs to be more flexible
* Crawling through docs endlessly
* Docs were complete and easy-to-understand (relatively)
* Better than Node docs
* Pace of bootcamp

* Final? Rails/React
* Migrations? Source control for the database

### Rails Libraries
* Active Record
  * ORM - object relational mapper
  * Allows you to query the db using OOP
* Action View
  * Handles templates (server-side rendering)
* Action Controller
  * Control the request logic
* Action Dispatch
  * Rails router
* Active Support
  * Helper libraries
* Action Mailer
  * Send emails
* Action Cable
  * Websockets for Rails
* Active Storage
  * Storing files/docs

### MVC
* Model - responsible for data logic
* View - template UI
* Controller - talks to both, talks to the router

* MV*
* React MVVM - Model View View-Model - each component has it's own logic (aka mini-controller)
